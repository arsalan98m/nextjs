// ********** ISR(Incremental Static Regeneration) *************** //

1. ISR(Incremental Static Generation) it means you are not generate statically page at build time but that it's continously updated even after deployment without you re-deploying it

2. In ISR NextJS generates new pages & re-generates current pages on the fly when data is updated

Example: 
1. There is no change on first visit after the content is changed.
2. The page visit triggers NextJS to re-fetch the page data in bg 
3. The Static Page is regenerated ready for the next visit

Anoter Example in my words:
Misaal ky tor par mainy apni app main api attach kari jismy 3 products arahay hai or mainy build bana kar app deploy kar diya 
ab user jab bhi visit karega tu ussy yeh 3 products show hongi ab agar main 4th product add karta hoon tu static generation main kya hoga ky mujhy dobara sy apny pc main build bana kar deploy karna hoga tu ja kar 4th product show hogi lekin agar hum ISR use kary hain tu usmy hum time bataty hain k jab user page trigger karega tu kitny time main dobara regeneration karni hai 
Ismy hota aisa hai k wohi 3 products wali example ab ismy many 4th product add kari ab jab user page trigger karega tu mainy 10 sec lagay hain k jasiy user trigger karega usky 10s main dobara build bana na ab 10 sec baad build ban gayi isky baad user dobara trigger karega tu isky pass updated data show hoga or baqi users ka pass bhi updated data show hoga yeh flow chalta hai isr main
