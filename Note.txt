 // ===   Client Side Fetching === //

If your page contains frequently updating data, and you don't need to pre-render the data, SWR is a perfect fit and no special needed. just import 'useSWR' and use the hook inside any components that use the data.

Here's how it works:

First, immediately show the pag without data. You can show loading states for missing data.
Then, fetch the data on the Client side and display it when ready.

This approach works well for user dashboard pages, for example. Becuase a dashboard is private, user-specific page, SEO is not relevant and the page doesn't need to be pre-rendered. The data is frequently updated which requires-time data fetching.
